## üéØ Remember: The Goal is Insights, Not Validation

**Success = Deep understanding of user needs**
**Failure = Building features users don't want**

Your alpha testers are not just testers - they're co-creators of LearnFlow's future. Treat them as partners, listen deeply to their stories, and use their insights to build something students truly love.

**Ready to launch? Let's make LearnFlow the study tool students have been waiting for! üöÄ**
